# Code challenge

Build a simple social networking application, similar to Twitter, and
expose it through a web API. The application should support the scenarios
below.

## Scenarios

### Posting

A user should be able to post a 140 characters message.

### Wall

A user should be able to see a list of the messages they've posted, in reverse
chronological order.

### Following

A user should be able to follow another user. Following doesn't have to be
reciprocal: Alice can follow Bob without Bob having to follow Alice.

### Timeline

A user should be able to see a list of the messages posted by all the people
they follow, in reverse chronological order.

## Details

- don't care about registering users: a user is created as soon as they post
  their first message
- don't care about user authentication
- don't care about storage: storing everything in memory is fine

## Submitting

Please submit your code as a ZIP archive or a tarball. We'll try to run your
submission on a macOS or Linux machine. Please include a README with
instructions on how to build and run your project, including any necessary
dependencies.

## Tips

Please write your solution in a language you feel confident in, provided there
is an easy option to build it and run it on macOS/Linux.

Please take your time to come up with a solution you like. We appreciate people
have day jobs and other commitments,so please let us know if you need more
time!
